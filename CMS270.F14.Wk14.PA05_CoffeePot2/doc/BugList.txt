Patrick:

Bug: If you click three sugars the + disappears like it should but if you hit - 
on the sugar the + does not reappear. If you hit + twice instead of three times 
the – appears and you can hit minus twice and the minus will disappear as it 
should. So it’s keeping track properly the + just doesn’t come back once it’s 
gone. 

Bug: I added 100 cream causing the + to disappear and then hit the - but just like 
sugar, the + does not reappear. 

Bug: When you select coffee, cash, input any money and hit order, it dispenses but 
the money does not get decremented and does not get checked for the correct 
price. 


Scot:

Enhancement:  when a new transaction is started, it doesn't clear the 
txtAreaLeft or txtAreaRight boxes.

Bug:  does not disable the coin buttons after checking out with cash.

Bug:  sometimes the order button is disabled when not enough cash is inserted.
