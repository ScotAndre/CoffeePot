Patrick:

Bug: Start program. Choose Coffee -> Cash -> any amount of money. -> Order.
     It dispenses, but the money does not get decremented and does not get 
     checked for the correct price. 
     
     Checked:  It only happens the second time through
        Coffee -> Cash -> Quarter -> Order -- will not dispense 1st time through
        Coffee -> Cash -> Quarter -> Order -> Coin Return
            -- will return the quarter and reset, but...
        Coffee -> Cash -> Quarter -> Order again, it will dispense.

Bug: Start program.  Choose Coffee -> rCard -> order this works, then then if
     you choose Coffee -> rCard the order button doesn't reactivate.

Bug: Start the program.  Choose Cash -> Quarter -> order -> Coin Return ->  
     Cash -> Quarter -> Quarter -> Coffee ->  Order -> Coin Return
     The second order dispenses like it should, but when you hit coin return,
     it will return all 50 cents.
      
Bug: rCard only works with the first iteration.


Scot:

Enhancement:  When a new transaction is started, it doesn't clear the 
              txtAreaLeft or txtAreaRight boxes.

Bug:  does not disable the coin buttons after checking out with cash.

Bug:  sometimes the order button is disabled when not enough cash is inserted.
