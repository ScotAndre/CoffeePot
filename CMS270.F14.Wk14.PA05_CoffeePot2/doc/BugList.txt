Bug: Start program. Choose Coffee -> Cash -> any amount of money. -> Order.
     It dispenses, but the money does not get decremented and does not get 
     checked for the correct price. 

Bug: Start program.  Choose Coffee -> rCard -> order this works, then then if
     you choose Coffee -> rCard the order button doesn't reactivate.

     Cash -> Quarter -> Quarter -> Coffee ->  Order -> Coin Return
     The second order dispenses like it should, but when you hit coin return,
     it will return all 50 cents.
      
Bug: rCard only works with the first iteration.
